# HLTV Enjoyability Predictor Chrome Extension
A Bournemouth University Final Year Project Artefact

## Introduction
As part of my final year project I undertook a research project with the aim of improving esports spectator experience, specifically for professional CS:GO spectators. 
I achieved this aim through through development of a Google Chrome Extension and supporting API. The following GitHub repositories contain the developed Chrome extension and API in their submitted states.

The Chrome extension was developed using JavaScrpt. The API was developed using Python (Flask) and deployed to Google Cloud Platform.
The API relies on a Machine Learning algorithm developed with Jupyter Notebook and the scikit-learn library.
